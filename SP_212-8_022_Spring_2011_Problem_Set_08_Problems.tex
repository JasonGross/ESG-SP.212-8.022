\section{Problem \thesection: Long flat conductor}
  A long flat conductor of width $a$ carries a sheet of current $i$ (see
  \autoref{fig:flat}). You are asked to find the magnetic field (direction and
  magnitude) near the center of its flat side and and very close to the
  surface, such that the distance $R$ from the sheet is $R \ll a$.

\section{Problem \thesection: Magnetic field of three wires --- Purcell 6.5}
  Three long straight parallel wires are located as shown in the diagram. One
  wire (B) carries current $2 I$ into the paper; each of the others (A and C)
  carries current $I$ in the opposite direction. What is the strength if the
  magnetic field at $P_1$ and $P_{2}$?

\section{Problem \thesection: Bent wire revisited}
  In class we found the magnetic field at the center of a wire bent through
  $180^\circ$.  Solve it instead for the wire bent through some arbitrary
  angle.
\section{Problem \thesection: Magnetic field due to a spinning disk}
  A flat circular disk with radius $R$ carries a uniform surface charge density
  $\sigma$. It rotates with an angular velocity $\omega$ about the $z$-axis.
  Find the magnetic field $\vec{B}(z)$ at any point $z$ along the rotation
  axis.

\section{Problem \thesection: Coaxial cable}
  A long coaxial cable consists of two concentric conductors, as shown in
  \autoref{fig:coax} below.  The inner conductor is a cylinder with radius $a$,
  and it carries a current $I$ uniformly distributed over its cross section.
  The outer conductor is a cylindrical shell with inner radius $b$ and outer
  radius $c$. It carries a current $I$ that is also uniformly distributed over
  its cross section, and that is opposite in direction to the current of the
  inner conductor.  Calculate the magnetic field $\vec{B}$  and plot the field
  strength as a function of the distance from the axis.

\section{Problem \thesection: Rectangular Toroidal Solenoid --- Purcell 6.14}
  What is the magnetic field inside and outside of the solenoid in \autoref{fig:toroid}?

\section{Problem \thesection: Vector potential of a solenoid}
  Find the vector potential $\vec A$ inside and outside of an infinite solenoid
  of radius $R$ with $n$ turns per centimeter, each carrying current $I$.  Find
  the solution for $\vec A$ which is symmetric about the axis of the solenoid.

  \noindent \textsc{Hint}: You can come up with a \emph{very} simple way to
  compute $\vec A$ by putting together
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The magnetic flux, $\Phi_B = \int \vec B\cdot d\vec a$
    \item The definition $\vec B = \vec\nabla\times\vec A$
    \item Stoke's theorem.
  \end{itemize}
\section{Problem \thesection: The Director's Challenge --- Extra credit!!!}
  Formulate an interesting problem that relates a topic from 8.022 to your
  intended major or any topic about which you are passionate.  Give references
  to help future students to understand the context.  Try to give a solution.
  Any method, theoretical, analytical, numerical, experimental, is acceptable.
  If you can't give a full solution, outline partial solutions. Enjoy!
