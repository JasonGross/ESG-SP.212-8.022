\section{Problem \thesection: Long flat conductor}
\subsection{Problem}
  A long flat conductor of width $a$ carries a sheet of current $i$ (see
  \autoref{fig:flat}). You are asked to find the magnetic field (direction and
  magnitude) near the center of its flat side and and very close to the
  surface, such that the distance $R$ from the sheet is $R \ll a$.

  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 10cm]{flat_conductor}
    \caption{Flat conductor}
    \label{fig:flat}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Solution}

  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 12cm]{flat_conductor_sol}
    \label{fig:flatsol}
  \end{figure}

  As shown in the figure, above the conductor, $\vec{B}$ points to the left,
  below the conductor, $\vec{B}$  points to the right (the current is pointing
  out of the paper).  Choose an amperian path shown in the plot, since the
  distance $R$ is much smaller than $a$, we have:
  \begin{equation}
    2B \times L = \frac{4 \pi}{c} I_{\text{enc}} = \frac{4 \pi}{c} \frac{L i}{a}
  \end{equation}
  Hence $B=\frac{2 \pi i}{a c}$.
\section{Problem \thesection: Magnetic field of three wires --- Purcell 6.5}
\subsection{Problem}
Three long straight parallel wires are located as shown in the diagram. One wire (B) carries current $2 I$ into the paper;
 each of the others (A and C) carries current $I$ in the opposite direction. What is the strength if the magnetic field at $P_1$
  and $P_{2}$?

   \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{Threewires}
    \label{fig:threewire}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Solution}
The field generated by the wires $A$ and $C$ cancel at the point $P_{1}$. Hence, the magnetic field at point $P_{1}$ is same as the magnetic field due to the wire $B$ which is,
$$\vec{B}_{1} = -\frac{2 (2I)}{ c d/\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} } \hat{x}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} } \hat{y} \right) = -\frac{4I}{cd} ( \hat{x} +  \hat{y})$$
This field is perpendicular to the line joining $B$ and $P_{1}$ and it points towards $A$.\\
\noindent  The magnetic field due to wire $A$ at point $P_{2}$ is
$$\vec{B}_{2A} =\frac {2 I}{cd}  \hat{y}$$
Similarly, the field due to the wire $C$ is
$$\vec{B}_{2C} = \frac{2 I}{cd}  \hat{x}$$
The contribution of the wire $B$ to the field at point $P_{2}$ is half of its contribution to the field at $P_{1}$:
$$\vec{B}_{2B} =  -\frac{2I}{cd} ( \hat{x} +  \hat{y)}$$
Hence, the net magnetic field at point $P_{2}$ is zero.
\section{Problem \thesection: Bent wire revisited}
\subsection{Problem}
In class we found the magnetic field at the center of a wire bent through $180^\circ$.
Solve it instead for the wire bent through some arbitrary angle.
\subsection{Solution}


   \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{BS1v05}
    \label{fig:bentwire}
  \end{figure}

Refer to Figure \autoref{fig:bentwire}.  To calculate the magnetic
field, we decompose the wire into two semi-infinite long wires AB and
CD and an arc BC of angle $\theta$.  Each part of the wire contribute to $\vec{B}$ in
the same direction, that is normal to and out of the page.  By Ampere's law we
can calculate a magnetic field of a {\sl whole} infinite long wire
$B\times 2\pi r=(4\pi/c)I$, or $B=2I/cr$.   $\vec{B}$ given by the
{\sl half}-infinite long wire AB is just $B_{AB}=(1/2)\times
(2I/cr)=I/cr$.  The same amount is contributed to $\vec{B}$ given by
CD.  For the arc BC,
\begin{equation}
B_{BC}=\int\frac{Idl}{cr^2}=\frac{I\times \theta r}{cr^2}=\frac{\theta I}{cr}\quad\textrm{($\theta$ in radian)}
\end{equation}
So the total magnetic field at point P is
\begin{equation}
\vec B_P=\frac{(2+\theta)I}{cr}\hat z\;,
\end{equation}
where $\hat z$ points out of the page.

\section{Problem \thesection: Magnetic field due to a spinning disk}
\subsection{Problem}
A flat circular disk with radius $R$ carries a uniform surface charge density
$\sigma$. It rotates with an angular velocity $\omega$ about the $z$-axis.
Find the magnetic field $\vec{B}(z)$ at any point $z$ along the rotation axis.

   \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{Spinningdisk}
    \label{fig:spinningdisk}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Solution}
We treat the spinning disk as a
series of infinitesimal loops for which we already know the field. The
field generated by a loop of radius $b$ is
$$B_z = \frac{2\pi b^2 I}{c(b^2+z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\quad\rightarrow\quad dB_z = \frac{2\pi b^2 dI}{c(b^2+z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \quad dI = \sigma\omega bdb$$
 Integrating over the whole disk we find,
$$B_z = \int_0^R \frac{2\pi b^2 \sigma\omega
b}{c(b^2+z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}db =
\frac{2\pi\sigma\omega}{c}\left(\frac{R^2+2z^2}{\sqrt{R^2+z^2}}-2|z|\right)
$$
\section{Problem \thesection: Coaxial cable}
\subsection{Problem}
A long coaxial cable consists of two concentric conductors, as shown in Fig. \autoref{fig:spinningdisk} below.
The inner conductor is a cylinder with radius $a$, and it carries a current $I$
uniformly distributed over its cross section. The outer conductor is a cylindrical shell with
inner radius $b$ and outer radius $c$. It carries a current $I$ that is also uniformly
distributed over its cross section, and that is opposite in direction to the current of the
inner conductor.  Calculate the magnetic field $\vec{B}$  and plot the field strength as a function of
the distance from the axis.

   \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{coax}
    \caption{Cross-section of a long coaxial cable.}
    \label{fig:spinningdisk}
  \end{figure}
\subsection{Solution}
We will make use of the cylindrical symmetry and Ampere's law to evaluate the magnetic field everywhere.
\begin{itemize}
\item In the region $R<a$,
$$2\pi R B = \frac{4\pi}{c} J_1\pi R^2 \implies \vec{B} = \frac{2IR}{ca^2}\hat{\theta}$$
where $J_1$ is the current density in this region and it is given by,
$$J_{1} = {I \over \pi a^{2}}$$
\item
In the region $(b > R > a)$ $$  2\pi R B = \frac{4\pi}{c} J_1\pi a^2
\implies \vec{B} = \frac{2I}{cR}\hat{\theta}$$
\item
In the region $(c > R > b)$, the current density is $J_{3} = I/\pi ( c^2 - b^2 )$. Hence,
 $$2\pi R B = \frac{4\pi}{c} ( I  -
J_3\pi(R^2-b^2)) \implies \vec{B} =
\frac{2I}{cR}\left(\frac{c^2 - R^2}{c^2 -b^2}\right)\hat{\theta}$$
\item
In the region $(d > R > c)$ $$ B.2\pi R = \frac{4\pi}{c} ( I - I) \implies \vec{B} = 0 $$
\end{itemize}
\section{Problem \thesection: Rectangular Toroidal Solenoid --- Purcell 6.14}
\subsection{Problem}

What is the magnetic field inside and outside of the solenoid in figure \autoref{fig:toroid}?

   \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{Toroid}
    \label{fig:toroid}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Solution}
Cylindrical symmetry demands that the magnetic field must be azimuthal everywhere and has only radial dependence.
Note that the current enclosed by a circular
Amperian loop with radius less than the inner radius encloses zero current {\it i.e.}, $I_{enc} = 0$.
A circular Amperian loop with radius greater than the outer radius encloses zero net current ($I_{enc} = NI - NI = 0$). Therefore, the field is zero
everywhere outside the toroid.

The field inside can be calculated using Ampere's
law as follows.
$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{s} = \frac{4\pi}{c}I_{enc}  \implies \quad B 2 \pi R
= \frac{4\pi}{c}NI  \implies \quad \vec{B} =
\frac{2NI}{cR}\hat{\theta} $$

\section{Problem \thesection: Vector potential of a solenoid }
\subsection{Problem}
Find the vector
potential $\vec A$ inside and outside of an infinite solenoid of
radius $R$ with $n$ turns per centimeter, each carrying current $I$.
Find the solution for $\vec A$ which is symmetric about the axis of
the solenoid.

{\bf HINT}: You can come up with a {\it very} simple way to compute
$\vec A$ by putting together

\begin{itemize}

\item The magnetic flux, $\Phi_B = \int \vec B\cdot d\vec a$

\item The definition $\vec B = \vec\nabla\times\vec A$

\item Stoke's theorem.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution}
What is the magnetic field inside and outside of the solenoid in figure \autoref{fig:toroid}?
   \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{vecpot7}
    \label{fig:potential}
  \end{figure}
The magnetic field of a infinite solenoid is uniform inside and zero outside them.  By Ampere's law, $Bl=(4\pi/c)nlI$ for
$r<R$ where $l$ is some axial length.  So
\begin{equation}
\vec{B}= \left\{\begin{array}{r@{\quad,\quad}l}
(4\pi/c)nI\hat{z} & r<R\\0 & r>R \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
The  magnetic flux through a surface area bounded by a
circle $C$ of radius $r$ (see Figure \autoref{fig:potential}) is:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_B = \left\{\begin{array}{r@{\quad,\quad}l}
(4\pi^2/c)nIr^2 & r<R\\ (4\pi^2/c)nIR^2 & r>R
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
  By Stoke's Theorem,

\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi_B &=& \int \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{a}=\int \nabla\times\vec{A}\cdot
d\vec{a}\nonumber\\
&=& \oint \vec{A}\cdot d\vec{l}\nonumber.
\end{eqnarray}

We seek  a solution that is symmetric about the z-axis.  The
simplest one is $\vec{A}=A\hat\phi$, i.e. along the ``circumferential''
direction.
\[ \oint \vec{A}\cdot d\vec{l}\nonumber = A\times 2\pi r.\]
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
A = \left\{\begin{array}{r@{\quad,\quad}l}
(2\pi/c)nIr & r<R\\ (2\pi/c)nIR^2/r & r>R \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
You can check  that $\nabla\times \vec{A}=\vec{B}$ in
cylindrical coordinates  both inside and outside.  Note that
in the exterior $\vec{A}$ is non-zero, even though $\vec{B}$ is zero there.
