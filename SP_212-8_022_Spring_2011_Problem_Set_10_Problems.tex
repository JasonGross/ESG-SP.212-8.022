\section{Problem \thesection: Problem 1 Purcell 7.17}
 Extra question --- By grounding this circuit, we make the switch
safer to operate. Describe why a large spark jumps across the switch
when it is not grounded, and why the spark does not happen when it is
grounded.
\section{Problem \thesection: Problem 2 Purcell 8.4}
\section{Problem \thesection: Problem 3 Purcell 8.7}
 A resonant cavity of the form illustrated is an essential part of many microwave oscillators. It can be regarded as a simple $LC$ circuit. The inductance is that of a toroid with one turn. Find an expression for the resonant frequency of this circuit and show by a sketch the configuration of the magnetic and electric fields.

An impedance $Z_o$ is to be connected to the terminals on the right. For given frequency $\omega$ find the value which $Z_o$ must have if the resulting impedance between the left terminals is $Z_o$. The required $Z_o$ is a pure resistance $R_o$ provided $\omega^2<2/LC$. What is $Z_o$ in the special case $\omega = \sqrt{2/LC}$?
