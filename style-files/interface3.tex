% This document will typeset the LaTeX3 interface descriptions a single
% document. This will produce quite a large file (more than 170 pages
% currently) and may take a long time on a slow machine.
%
% There is also a full version of the sources (source3.tex) which additionally
% also typesets the command implementations.
%
% Do not forget to generate the index (as explained on the terminal output
% near the end of the run)!
