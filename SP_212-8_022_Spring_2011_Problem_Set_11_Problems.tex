\section{Problem \thesection: Discovery of magnetic charge}
You discover magnetic
charge.  The units of magnetic charge density,
$\mu$, are chosen such that $\vec\nabla\cdot\vec B = 4\pi\mu$.

\par\noindent (a) When this magnetic charge is in motion,
there is a ``magnetic current density'' $\vec L = \mu \vec v$.  In
analogy to electric charge density and electric current densities,
write down the equation of continuity for magnetic charge.

\par\noindent (b) What do Maxwell's equations become with this
new charge?
\section{Problem \thesection:  Magnetic field of a moving charge}
A charge $q$ moving
along the $x$-axis at constant speed $v \ll c$.  When it is at $x =
-d$, what is the magnetic field at $(x,y,z) = (0,r,0)$?

\par\noindent (a)  Solve this first using Biot-Savart.  (Hint:
the current from the moving charge isn't particularly well defined.
However, B-S only needs the combination $I dl = (dq/dt) dl = dq
(dl/dt) \simeq q_{\rm pt\ charge}(dl/dt)$.  Sloppy physicist calculus
in action!)

\par\noindent (b)  Now solve this using displacement current.
Look at a circle of radius $r$ centered at the origin and passing
through the point $(0,r,0)$.  By symmetry, $\vec B$ will be constant
on this circle and oriented in the tangential direction.  Find a
surface which has this circle as a boundary and for which $\int \vec
E\cdot d\vec a$ is simple.  Evaluate this flux, apply the
``generalized'' form of Ampere's law (integral formulation) and you're
there.

\par\noindent Note, there's a third way: Lorentz transform from the
rest frame electric field (which you used on a previous pset).  All
three answers should agree, at least in the limit $v \ll c$.

\section{Problem \thesection: The Director's Challenge --- Extra credit!!!}
  Formulate an interesting problem that relates a topic from 8.022 to your
  intended major or any other topic about which you are passionate.  Give references
  to help future students to understand the context.  Try to give a solution.
  Any method --- theoretical, analytical, numerical, experimental --- is acceptable.
  If you can't give a full solution, outline partial solutions. Enjoy!
