\begin{problem}{Falling rectangular loop}
%Peter F10 #7
  A rectangular loop of wire with mass $m$, width $w$, vertical length $l$, and resistance $R$ falls out of a magnetic field under the influence of gravity. The magnetic field is uniform with magnitude $\vec{B}$ and out of the paper within the area shown in the sketch  and
   zero outside that area. At the time $t$, the loop is exiting the magnetic field at speed, $v(t) > 0$ (the loop ismoving downward). What is the terminal velocity of the loop?

\begin{problem}{Crossbar sliding in magnetic field}
%Scott S05 #7
A metal crossbar of mass $m$ slides without friction on two long parallel conducting rails a distance $b$ apart.
A resistor $R$ is connected across the rails at one end. The resistance of the bar and the rails is negligible.
There is a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ perpendicular to the page. At time $t=0$ the crossbar is given a velocity
$v_0$ towards the right.

  \begin{figure}[H]

  \end{figure}

\par\noindent (a) Write down a differential equation of the form
$dv/dt = \mbox{something}$ that governs the motion of the sliding
crossbar.

\par\noindent (b) Integrate this to find the velocity $v(t)$ for all
$t > 0$.

\par\noindent (c) Compute the total distance that the cross bar moves.

\par\noindent (d) Show that the {\it total} energy dissipated in the
resistor makes sense given the initial velocity of the crossbar.

\begin{problem}{Generate electricity at the gym}
In class we discussed that, given the definition of magnetic flux, there are essentially three ways that we can make it vary and thereby create an EMF: we can \\
\noindent a) make the area vary;\\
\noindent b) change the relative orientation of the magnetic field and the area; \\
\noindent c) make the magnetic field vary. \\

\noindent Think how to use gym exercise machines to produce electricity in each of the three ways. Be creative!
Try to make some estimates of the power you can produce. Extra credit if you suggest one detailed design.

\begin{problem}{Purcell 7.11 --- Self inductance connecting two coils}
%Scott S05 #8
Two coils with self-inductances $L_1$ and $L_2$ and mutual inductance $M$  are shown with the positive direction for current and electromotive force indicated. The equations relating currents and emf's are
\begin{equation}
{\cal E}_1 = -L_1\frac{dI_1}{dt}\pm M\frac{dI_2}{dt} \; {\cal E}_2 = -L_2\frac{dI_2}{dt}\pm M\frac{dI_1}{dt}
\end{equation}
Given that $M$ is always to be taken as positive, how must the signs be chosen in these equations? What if we had chosen the other direction for positive current and emf in the lower coil? Now connect the two coils together as in $b$. What is the inductance $L'$ of this circuit? What is the inductance $L''$ of the circuit formed as shown in $c$? Which circuit has the greater self-inductance? Considering that the self-inductance of any circuit must be a positive quantity, see if you can deduce anything concerning the relative magnitudes of $L_1$, $L_2$, and $M$.

\begin{problem}{Purcell 7.18 --- Switching off an electromagnet}
%Scott S05 #8
A circular coil of wire, with $N$ turns of radius $a$, is located in the field of an electromagnet.
The magnetic field is perpendicular to the coil, and its strength has the constant value $B_{0}$ over that area.
The coil is connected by a pair of twisted leads to an external resistance. The total resistance of this closed
 circuit is $R$. Suppose the electromagnet is turned off, its field dropping more or less rapidly to zero. Derive
  the formula for the total charge which passes through the resistor and explain why it does not depend on the rapidity
  with which the field drops to zero.

\begin{problem}{Purcell 7.20 --- B due to a ring current}
%Scott S05 #8
Can you devise a way to use the theorem $\Phi_{21}=\Phi_{12}$ to find the magnetic
 field strength due to a ring current at points in the plane of the ring at a distance from the ring much greater than the ring radius?
 Hint: consider two concentric rings of radius $R_{2}$ and $R_{1}$, $R_{1}>R_{2}$ and evaluate the effect of a small change
  of the radius of the outer ring on $\Phi_{21}$ and $\Phi_{12}$.

\begin{problem}{Purcell 7.22 --- Rotating ring}
%Scott S05 #8
A thin ring of radius $a$ carries a static charge $q$. This ring is in a magnetic field of strength $B_0$, parallel to the ring's axis, and is supported so that it is free to rotate about that axis. If the field is switched off, how much angular momentum will be added to the ring? If the ring has mass $m$, how much angular velocity will it acquire?
% an angular velocity $\omega = qB_0/2mc$.

\begin{problem}{Self inductance per unit length of coaxial conductors }
%Scott S05 #8
A transmission line consists of a pair of nested, long cylindrical
tubes with radii $R_1$ and $R_2$:

  \begin{figure}[H]

\par\noindent The current $I$ flows up the outer tube and down in the
inner tube; these currents are uniformly distributed over their
respective surface.  Compute the self inductance per unit length of
this configuration.  Hint: make life easy for yourself and do so using
magnetic energy.
