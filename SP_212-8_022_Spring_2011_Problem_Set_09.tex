\begin{problem}{Falling rectangular loop}
%Peter F10 #7
  A rectangular loop of wire with mass $m$, width $w$, vertical length $l$, and
  resistance $R$ falls out of a magnetic field under the influence of gravity.
  The magnetic field is uniform with magnitude $\vec{B}$ and out of the paper
  within the area shown in the sketch and zero outside that area. At the time
  $t$, the loop is exiting the magnetic field at speed, $v(t)$. What is the
  terminal velocity of the loop?

\begin{problem}{Crossbar sliding in magnetic field}
  %Scott S05 #7
  A metal crossbar of mass $m$ slides without friction on two long parallel
  conducting rails a distance $b$ apart.  A resistor $R$ is connected across
  the rails at one end. The resistance of the bar and the rails is negligible.
  There is a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ perpendicular to the page. At
  time $t=0$ the crossbar is given a velocity $v_0$ towards the right.

\begin{problem}{Generate electricity at the gym}
  In class we discussed that, given the definition of magnetic flux, there are
  essentially three ways that we can make it vary and thereby create an EMF: we
  can
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item make the area vary;
    \item change the relative orientation of the magnetic field and the area;
    \item make the magnetic field vary.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  Think how to use gym exercise machines to produce electricity in each of the
  three ways. Be creative! 
  Try to make some estimates of the power you can produce. Extra credit if you
  suggest one detailed design.

\begin{problem}{Purcell 7.11 --- Inductance of two coils}
%Scott S05 #8
  Two coils with self-inductances $L_1$ and $L_2$ and mutual inductance $M$
  are shown with the positive direction for current and electromotive force
  indicated. The equations relating currents and emf's are
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{E}_1 & = -L_1\frac{dI_1}{dt}\pm M\frac{dI_2}{dt} 
    & \mathcal{E}_2 & = -L_2\frac{dI_2}{dt}\pm M\frac{dI_1}{dt}
  \end{align*}
  
  Given that $M$ is always to be taken as positive, how must the signs be
  chosen in these equations? What if we had chosen the other direction for
  positive current and emf in the lower coil? Now connect the two coils
  together as in $b$. What is the inductance $L'$ of this circuit? What is the
  inductance $L''$ of the circuit formed as shown in $c$? Which circuit has the
  greater self-inductance? Considering that the self-inductance of any circuit
  must be a positive quantity, see if you can deduce anything concerning the
  relative magnitudes of $L_1$, $L_2$, and $M$.

\begin{problem}{Purcell 7.18 --- Total charge flow from induced EMF}
%Scott S05 #8
  A circular coil of wire, with $N$ turns of radius $a$, is located in the
  field of an electromagnet.  The magnetic field is perpendicular to the coil,
  and its strength has the constant value $B_{0}$ over that area.  The coil is
  connected by a pair of twisted leads to an external resistance. The total
  resistance of this closed circuit is $R$. Suppose the electromagnet is turned
  off, its field dropping more or less rapidly to zero. Derive the formula for
  the total charge which passes through the resistor and explain why it does
  not depend on the rapidity with which the field drops to zero.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  ${\mathcal{E}}(t) = -(1/c)d\Phi/dt$ and $I(t) =
  {\mathcal{E}}(t)/R$.  Therefore the charge flowing through the closed
  circuit is
  \begin{equation}
    Q=\int I(t)dt=\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} -\frac{d\Phi}{cR}
    = \frac{(\Phi(t_{i}) - \Phi(t_{i}))
    }{cR}=\frac{NB_0\pi a^2}{cR}.
  \end{equation}
  Since it only depends on the initial and final flux (and hence the initial
  and final field, the final field being zero), it doesn't matter how quickly
  we shut the field off --- we can do it in a microsecond, or we can ramp it
  down over a decade.
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}{Purcell 7.20 --- Magnetic field due to a loop far from the loop}
%Scott S05 #8
  Can you devise a way to use the theorem $\Phi_{21}=\Phi_{12}$ to find the
  magnetic field strength due to a ring current at points in the plane of the
  ring at a distance from the ring much greater than the ring radius?
 
  \noindent \textsc{Hint}: consider two concentric coplanar rings of radius
  $R_{2}$ and $R_{1}$, $R_{1}\gg R_{2}$ and evaluate the effect of a small
  change of the radius of the outer ring on $\Phi_{21}$ and $\Phi_{12}$.
  
  \noindent \textsc{More detailed hint}:  we wish to calculate the magnetic
  field of the small loop at the location of the large loop.  Since the large
  loop is of a radius $R_1 \gg R_2$, this will tell us the magnetic field of a
  small loop at any radius $r \gg R_2$, at least in the plane of the small
  loop. The trick here is to calculate the {\it change} in flux, $\Delta\Phi_B$
  that occurs if we adjust the radius $R_1$ by some amount $\Delta R_1$.  Do
  this with the reciprocity theorem: first, work out $\delta\Phi_B$ by running
  the current through the big loop.  Reciprocity says we must get the same
  $\delta\Phi_B$ when you run the current through the small loop.

\begin{problem}{Purcell 7.22 --- Spinning a charged ring}
%Scott S05 #8
  A thin ring of radius $a$ carries a static charge $q$. This ring is in a
  magnetic field of strength $B_0$, parallel to the ring's axis, and is
  supported so that it is free to rotate about that axis. If the field is
  switched off, how much angular momentum will be added to the ring? If the
  ring has mass $m$, how much angular velocity will it acquire?
  
  \noindent \textsc{Hint}: the variation of magnetic field induces an electric
  field along the ring, which accelerates it. The electric force creates a
  torque about the ring's axis.
  % an angular velocity $\omega = qB_0/2mc$. 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Apply Faraday's law of induction:
  \begin{align*}
    \Phi_B(t) & = B(t)\pi a^2, \\
    {\mathcal{E}}(t) & = \int_C \vec{E}(t)\cdot d\vec{s} = E(t)\times 2\pi a \\
      & = -\frac{1}{c}\frac{d\Phi_B(t)}{dt}=\frac{\pi a^2}{c}\left(-\frac{dB}{dt}\right) \\
  \text{or}\qquad E(t) & = \frac{a}{2c}\left(-\frac{dB}{dt}\right).
  \end{align*}
  The force on the charge is $F(t)=qE(t)$, along the loop
  direction; so its torque about the ring's axis is $N(t)=F(t)a=
  (qa^2/2c)(-dB)/dt$.  Therefore the total angular momentum added to the ring is
  \begin{equation}\label{eqn6:deltaJ}
    \Delta J=\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} N(t)dt=-\frac{qa^2}{2c}\int_{B(t_{i})}^{B(t_{i})}dB=qa^2 B_0/2c,
  \end{equation}
  where $B_0$ is the initial magnetic field and $B(t_{f})=0$.  The
  momentum of inertia of the ring is  $I=ma^2$.  If the ring is
  initially at rest, the final angular velocity is
  \begin{equation}
    \omega=\frac{\Delta J}{I}=\frac{qB_0}{2mc}.
  \end{equation}
  Note that \autoref{eqn6:deltaJ} only depends on the initial and final
  values of the magnetic field, not the variation rate.

  Additional question: If you combine this calculation with the notion
  of angular momentum conservation, what can you infer about
  electromagnetic fields?

  This simply indicates that electromagnetic field has angular momentum
  of its own --- this angular momentum is transferred to the ring as the
  magnetic field switches off.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{Self inductance per unit length of coaxial conductors }
%Scott S05 #8
  A transmission line consists of a pair of nested, long cylindrical
  tubes with radii $R_1$ and $R_2$:

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 5cm]{coaxind}
    \label{fig:coax}
  \end{figure}

  The current $I$ flows up the outer tube and down in the
  inner tube; these currents are uniformly distributed over their
  respective surface.  Compute the self inductance per unit length of
  this configuration.
  
  \noindent \textsc{Hint}: make life easy for yourself and do so using
  magnetic energy.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  The magnetic field energy stored in an inductor is:
  \begin{equation}
    U=\int_{\text{Everywhere}} \frac{B^2}{8\pi} dV = \frac{1}{2}LI^2.
  \end{equation}
  The magnetic field around a cylindrical current flow of current
  $I$ and radius $R$ is given by applying Ampere's law,
  \begin{align*}
    B\times 2\pi r & = \begin{cases}
                        (4\pi/c)I & r>R \\
                        0 & r<R
                       \end{cases} \\
    \text{or}\qquad \vec{B} & = \begin{cases}
                                  (2I/cr) \hat{\theta} & r>R \\
                                  0 & r<R
                                \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  where $\hat{\theta}$ is the unit vector in ``circumferential''
  direction and its circulation obeys the right-hand-rule.\\

  For our problem, adding the contributions from the two cylindrical
  current flows of opposite directions, we have
  \begin{equation}
    \vec{B} = 
      \begin{cases}
        -(2I/cr) \hat{\theta} & R_1<r<R_2 \\ 
        0 & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
  So the total magnetic field energy \emph{per unit length} is
  \begin{align*}
    U_{l} & = \int_{\text{Everywhere}} \frac{dV}{l} \frac{B^2}{8\pi} 
      = \int_{R_1}^{R_2} 2\pi r\,dr \frac{(2I/cr)^2}{8\pi} \\
      & = \frac{I^2}{c^2}\ln\left(\frac{R_2}{R_1}\right),\\
    \text{so}\qquad L_{l} & = \frac{2U_{l}}{I^2}=\frac{2}{c^2}\ln{(\frac{R_2}{R_1})},
  \end{align*}
  where $L_{l}$ is the self-inductance \emph{per unit length}.
\end{solution}
